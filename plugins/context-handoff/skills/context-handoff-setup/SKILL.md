  - 'context-handoff extension missing'

# Context Handoff Setup

The **context-handoff extension** (the live context-window monitor: token
tracking + 55%/70% nudges + `generate_handoff_prompt` / `save_handoff_prompt`
tools) is **plugin-contributed** -- there is no install step. The Copilot CLI
discovers it directly from the plugin's `extensions/` dir when the plugin is
enabled. This skill is for the case where it is **not** loading.

For the `/handoff` authoring workflow itself, see the **context-handoff** skill.

## How it loads

When `context-handoff@copilot-extensions` is enabled, the CLI scans
`~/.copilot/installed-plugins/copilot-extensions/context-handoff/extensions/`
at session startup and loads `context-handoff/extension.mjs` as a `plugin`-source
extension. No copy to `~/.copilot/extensions/`, no `scripts/install.*`, no
manifest.

## Three conditions gate it

All must hold. Check them in order, then start a fresh session.

### 1. The plugin must be enabled

A marketplace plugin's `extensions/` dir is only scanned when the plugin is in
`enabledPlugins`. Confirm `copilot plugin list` shows
`context-handoff@copilot-extensions`. If missing, install it:

```bash
copilot plugin install context-handoff@copilot-extensions
```

To enable it everywhere on a machine, add it to the user settings file
`~/.copilot/settings.json`:

```json
{ "enabledPlugins": { "context-handoff@copilot-extensions": true } }
```

Or enable it per-repo in that repo's `.github/copilot/settings.json`.

### 2. experimental mode must be on

The CLI gates **all** extension loading behind `"experimental": true` in
`~/.copilot/settings.json`. This is ensured by the **agent-worktrees** installer
(`Ensure-CopilotExperimental`), run on `agent-worktrees install` / `update`. If
extensions are not loading at all, run:

```bash
agent-worktrees update
```

and confirm `"experimental": true` is present in `~/.copilot/settings.json`.

### 3. The launching harness must opt in

The extension registers its tools and event listeners only when Copilot starts
with `COPILOT_CONTEXT_HANDOFF=1`. A control-harness setup script should export
that variable immediately before it executes `copilot`:

```bash
export COPILOT_CONTEXT_HANDOFF=1
exec copilot "$@"
```

Starting `copilot` directly without that variable intentionally leaves the
extension inert.

## Verify

Start a fresh Copilot CLI session through the opted-in harness and confirm it
exposes `generate_handoff_prompt` / `save_handoff_prompt`. `/extensions` lists
`context-handoff` with source **plugin** (exactly once -- if you see it twice, a
stale copy exists under `~/.copilot/extensions/context-handoff/` or a project
`.github/extensions/`; the CLI loads every source with no dedup, so remove the
redundant copy).
